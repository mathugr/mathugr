To show certification information like issuer details and HSM integration in a conceptual diagram for mTLS between a client-side (external API) and Baronet API, you can use visual elements like icons, labels, and annotations to clearly convey the details. Here’s how to create such a diagram:

1. Overview of Diagram Components
Client Side: Represents the external API.
Server Side: Represents the Baronet API.
Certificates: Visual elements for both client and server certificates.
Issuers: Labels or annotations showing who issued the certificates.
HSM: Visual elements to indicate that the private keys are stored and managed in an HSM.
2. Diagram Elements and Annotations
a. Client Side (External API)
Client Certificate: Represented by a document icon or a box labeled "Client Certificate".
Issuer Details: Connected to the certificate with a label like "Issued by: Internal CA".
Private Key in HSM: Use a lock icon or a box labeled "Private Key stored in HSM".
b. Server Side (Baronet API)
Server Certificate: Represented by a document icon or a box labeled "Server Certificate".
Issuer Details: Connected to the certificate with a label like "Issued by: Trusted CA".
Private Key in HSM: Use a lock icon or a box labeled "Private Key stored in HSM".

4. Detailed Explanation
Client Certificate:

Box or Icon: A rectangle or certificate icon labeled "Client Certificate".
Issuer Details: A smaller box or text label connected to the certificate indicating the issuer (e.g., "Issued by: Internal CA").
Private Key: A lock symbol or another rectangle below the certificate labeled "Private Key in HSM", indicating the key is stored securely in a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
Server Certificate:

Box or Icon: Similar to the client certificate, but on the server side, labeled "Server Certificate".
Issuer Details: Connected to the server certificate, labeled "Issued by: Trusted CA".
Private Key: Same as the client side, labeled "Private Key in HSM".
mTLS Connection:

Arrow: A double-headed arrow between the client and server sides representing the secure mTLS connection.
Label: Label the arrow with "mTLS Connection" to indicate that the connection is secured using mutual TLS.
5. Annotations for Additional Details
You can include additional notes or annotations near the relevant parts of the diagram:

CA Certificates: Mention that both the client and server have a list of trusted CA certificates to validate the certificates presented during the mTLS handshake.
HSM Details: Note that HSM is used for storing and protecting private keys, ensuring they are not exposed outside the secure module.
6. Tools to Create the Diagram
You can create these diagrams using tools like:

Lucidchart: For detailed flowcharts and network diagrams.
Draw.io (Diagrams.net): A free tool with a variety of shapes and icons.
Microsoft Visio: For more professional and complex diagrams.
Miro: For collaborative whiteboard-style diagrams.
Summary
The conceptual diagram for mTLS between an external API and Baronet API should include:

Certificates: Represent both client and server certificates with issuer details.
HSM Integration: Show that private keys are stored in HSMs on both sides.
mTLS Connection: Indicate that the connection is secured with mutual TLS.
This visual approach helps in clearly communicating the security architecture of your mTLS setup. Would you like any specific details added or have a preferred tool for creating these diagrams?
