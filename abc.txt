12/08/20042ETL Architecture Options - Overview 
12/08/20043 ETL Architecture Options - Guidelines • Provide information about the ETL tool. • Explain different components of ETL tool. • Provide architecture diagram of the ETL tool and mention how the different components of architecture interacts with each other. • Explain different plug-inns available with the ETL tool. Explain the command line interface if available. • Make sure that all the tool related concepts that you will be using through out the document are well explained here. • Explain the factors to be considered while suggesting the ETL infrastructure. This factors can be tool dependant, client environment dependant or it can be based on the best practices from Wipro's experience. • Provide different option of architecture by which the tool can be configured and use effectively in the organization, the option may be based on setup of repository setup. Provide pros and cons for each of the options. Limit the number of option to max 4 and then suggest the one appropriately which will suite the client's requirement and environment • Make sure that you are handling the geographically distributed architecture is required, also make sure that the architecture suggested is flexible enough to expand as needed • Provide different option for Disaster recovery solutions and Highly Availability System solutions
12/08/20044ETL Architecture Options - Guidelines • Architecture Option 1 Explain the architecture with the diagram and provide pros and cons. Explain how this option can be implemented in client environment. Probably this can be a distributed architecture ( explained in ETL Framework session) • Architecture Option 2 Explain the architecture with the diagram and provide pros and cons. Explain how this option can be implemented in client environment. Probably this can be a centralized architecture ( explained in ETL Framework session) • Architecture Option 3 Explain the architecture with the diagram and provide pros and cons. Explain how this option can be implemented in client environment. Probably this can be a geographically distributed architecture ( explained in ETL Framework session) • Recommendation for ETL Infrastructure Explain the recommended architecture option for ETL infrastructure and provide justification. Explain how client can be maximum benefited from the recommended architecture option in their current environment. Also provide small roadmap for client regarding how they should grow with this option. 

12/08/20045ETL Design Considerations 
12/08/20046ETL Design Considerations • Modularity • Consistency • Flexibility • Speed • Heterogeneity • Meta Data Management 
12/08/20047ETL Design Considerations • Modularity ETL systems should contain modular elements which encourages reuse and makes them easy to modify when implementing changes
 • Consistency ETL systems should guarantee consistency of data when it is loaded into the data warehouse. An entire data load should be treated as a single logical transaction— (either commit or rollback).
 • Flexibility ETL systems may be appropriate to accomplish some transformations in text files and some on the source data system; others may require the development of custom applications 

12/08/20048ETL Design Considerations 
• Speed ETL systems should be as fast as possible. 
• Heterogeneity ETL systems should be able to work with a wide variety of data in different formats

$permissions = "Modify"                          # Replace with the desired permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Modify, FullControl)

# Check if the file exists
if (Test-Path $filePath) {
    # Get the ACL of the file
    $acl = Get-Acl $filePath

    # Create a new rule for the user or group
    $permission = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule($userOrGroupName, $permissions, "Allow")

    # Add the permission to the ACL
    $acl.SetAccessRule($permission)

    # Set the ACL back to the file
    Set-Acl $filePath $acl

    Write-Host "Access granted to $userOrGroupName for $permissions in $filePath"

Assess Compatibility and Requirements:

Ensure that the corporate iPhones you plan to use have NFC capability. Most modern iPhones support NFC.
Select NFC Cards or Badges:

Choose NFC cards or badges for office access. These should be compatible with the NFC technology used by your access control system.
NFC Reader/Writer Hardware:

Purchase NFC reader/writer hardware that can connect to the iPhone. These devices often connect via Bluetooth or Lightning/USB-C port. Popular options include:

External NFC Reader: These are standalone NFC readers that can connect to iPhones via Bluetooth.
iOS App Development:

Develop a custom iOS app (or leverage an existing one if available) that can communicate with the NFC reader/writer hardware and interact with the NFC badges. You may need to work with a mobile app developer for this step.
App Features:

Implement features in the app that allow users to:
Scan and store the NFC badges.
Authenticate and verify access permissions.
Use the stored NFC badges for office access.
Security Measures:

Implement robust security measures to protect the stored NFC data, including encryption and secure storage within the app.
Ensure that only authorized personnel can access and use the app.
Integration with Access Control System:

Integrate the app with your office's access control system. This may involve working with your existing access control provider or building a custom solution.
Ensure that the app can communicate with the access control system to grant or deny access based on stored NFC badges.
User Registration and Badge Enrollment:

Create a process for registering users and enrolling their NFC badges in the system.
Train employees on how to use the app to scan and store their NFC badges.
Testing and Validation:

Thoroughly test the entire system to ensure it functions as expected and provides the necessary security.
Conduct pilot testing with a small group of users to identify and address any issues.
Deployment and Training:

Deploy the system to all corporate iPhones.
Provide training and documentation to employees on how to use the app and their NFC badges for office access.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Implement ongoing monitoring of the system for security and performance.
Regularly update the app to address any software issues or security vulnerabilities.
Provide support for employees who encounter problems or have questions.
Compliance and Legal Considerations:

Ensure that your system complies with relevant data protection and privacy regulations, such as GDPR or HIPAA.
Be aware of any legal requirements regarding access control and data storage in your jurisdiction.


Install the Access Control App:

Go to the App Store on your iPhone.
Search for and download the access control or badge management app provided by your organization.
Install the app on your iPhone.
Launch the App:

Open the app after installation.
Login or Register:

Depending on your organization's policies, you may need to log in using your corporate credentials or register for an account if it's your first time using the app.
Badge Enrollment:

Inside the app, look for an option to enroll your badge or access credentials.
Follow the app's instructions for enrollment. This typically involves scanning a QR code, entering a badge number, or following any other instructions provided by your organization.
Verification and Approval:

Your organization's security team or administration may need to verify your identity and access permissions before activating your digital badge on your iPhone. This verification process may involve review and approval.
Access Management:

Once your digital badge is activated, you can use it to gain access to various secure areas within your organization. This may include tapping your iPhone near card readers or following the app's specific instructions for access.
Additional Features:

Explore the app's settings to customize features such as displaying a digital badge on your iPhone's screen or using NFC for contactless access.
Security and Compliance:

Follow your organization's security policies and best practices to ensure that your digital badge is stored securely on your iPhone. Ensure that your device is password-protected, and consider enabling biometric authentication (e.g., Face ID or Touch ID) for added security.
Troubleshooting and Support:

If you encounter any issues during the setup process or while using the app, contact your organization's IT support or the app's customer support for assistance.
Regular Updates:

Keep the access control app and your iPhone's operating system up to date to ensure the latest security patches and features are applied.
