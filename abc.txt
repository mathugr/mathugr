12/08/20045ETL Design Considerations 
12/08/20046ETL Design Considerations • Modularity • Consistency • Flexibility • Speed • Heterogeneity • Meta Data Management 
12/08/20047ETL Design Considerations • Modularity ETL systems should contain modular elements which encourages reuse and makes them easy to modify when implementing changes
 • Consistency ETL systems should guarantee consistency of data when it is loaded into the data warehouse. An entire data load should be treated as a single logical transaction— (either commit or rollback).
 • Flexibility ETL systems may be appropriate to accomplish some transformations in text files and some on the source data system; others may require the development of custom applications 

12/08/20048ETL Design Considerations 
• Speed ETL systems should be as fast as possible. 
• Heterogeneity ETL systems should be able to work with a wide variety of data in different formats
