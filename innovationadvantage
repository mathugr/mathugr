Copilot = Smart Reader + Writer.

Your Assistant = Smart Sorter + Workflow Manager.

Together, they’d be complementary, not competitive.


Microsoft 365 (Exchange, Outlook rules, Flow/Power Automate) → Great for basic rules and workflows (forward, move, auto-reply).

Our AI Agent → Goes beyond static rules: it learns patterns, classifies intents, escalates, and tracks resolution status dynamically.

Microsoft 365 Copilot → Generative, but outputs can be inconsistent; audit trail is weak.

Our Agent → Non-generative and explainable → every action (classify, route, approve) is logged and reproducible.

Our Agent runs entirely inside enterprise proxy/firewall, ensuring no email leaves our environment → critical for regulatory & audit.


Microsoft 365 → Works great within Microsoft ecosystem (Exchange, Teams, SharePoint).

Our Agent → Designed to integrate with custom apps, CRMs, ServiceNow, internal APIs → not just Microsoft stack.


icrosoft 365 tools → Limited to what Microsoft provides. Harder to add domain-specific categories (e.g., “Regulatory Escalations” or “Risk Exceptions”).

Our Agent → Fully customizable: you define categories, escalation rules, dashboards, and reporting.
