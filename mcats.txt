he Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is a standardized exam that is required for admission to most medical schools in the United States and Canada. The MCAT does not have any specific major requirements, but it does require a strong foundation in the natural sciences, as well as critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Here are the recommended courses to take during your undergraduate studies to be eligible for the MCAT:

Biology: You should have a good understanding of biology, including molecular biology, genetics, microbiology, and cellular biology.

General Chemistry: You should have a strong foundation in general chemistry, including principles of chemical reactions and atomic structure.

Organic Chemistry: You should have a good understanding of organic chemistry, including the principles of chemical bonding and reaction mechanisms.

Physics: You should have a good foundation in physics, including mechanics, thermodynamics, electricity, and magnetism.

Psychology and Sociology: The MCAT also includes questions on psychological, social, and cultural factors that affect health and human behavior.

While there are no specific undergraduate majors required to be eligible for the MCAT, most students who take the exam have a strong background in the natural sciences, such as biology, chemistry, or physics. Additionally, it is important to have a well-rounded education, with courses in the humanities, social sciences, and ethics to develop critical thinking and communication skills that are essential for success in medical school.
