We’re excited to introduce our new Enterprise AI Agent—a secure, non-generative assistant that classifies and routes internal emails with precision. Built on SpaCy and Scikit-learn, it operates entirely within our proxy-safe environment and integrates seamlessly with both a chatbot interface and a new React-based dashboard for users who prefer structured workflows.

While the current release focuses on intent classification and secure retrieval, we’re actively designing future enhancements to support:

🔁 Automated follow-ups based on email engagement and status

⏰ Reminder scheduling to reduce missed responses

📊 Email status tracking (e.g., pending, responded, escalated) for visibility and accountability

🧠 Resolution monitoring agents that detect delays and escalate bottlenecks automatically

These features will help streamline internal communication, improve response times, and reduce manual tracking—while staying fully auditable and enterprise-safe.

Built on SpaCy and Scikit-learn, it operates entirely within our proxy-safe environment and integrates seamlessly with both our chatbot interface and a new React-based dashboard.

Whether users prefer conversational interaction or a structured UI, the agent ensures fast, accurate access to relevant internal messages—without relying on generative models or external APIs.

Key highlights:

🔍 Intent-based classification using SpaCy/Sklearn

📂 Internal email retrieval with secure routing

🖥️ Chatbot interface for conversational access

📊 React dashboard for structured, non-chat workflows

🧩 Optional GenAI extension (Hybrid RAG-ready)

🛡️ Fully auditable, modular, and proxy-friendly

This agent is designed to scale across departments and evolve into a contextual assistant when needed. Stay tuned for demo invites, onboarding materials, and dashboard access links.

“Our current system is a non-generative AI-powered assistant, built on secure, explainable ML techniques like Sklearn and SpaCy. It classifies and routes internal emails with high precision—without relying on generative models or external APIs. This ensures full control, auditability, and proxy-friendly deployment.

As a next step, we can optionally extend this into a hybrid RAG pipeline, enabling contextual generation while preserving enterprise constraints.”

Question;Suggested Response
How does this differ from existing email filters or rules?;"Traditional filters are static and rule-based. Ours is dynamic—learning from patterns, adapting to context, and enabling natural language interaction."
What’s the business ROI?;"We estimate a 20–30% reduction in time spent on email triage, with faster response times and improved compliance tracking."
How do you handle security and data privacy?;"All processing is internal-only, with no external API calls. We support role-based access, audit logging, and Exchange-native integration."
Can this scale across departments or geographies?;"Absolutely. The architecture is modular—new categories, languages, or integrations can be added without disrupting core functionality."
What’s the user adoption strategy?;"We offer both chatbot and dashboard interfaces to meet different user preferences, backed by onboarding guides and usage analytics."




“In today’s enterprise, email remains the backbone of communication—but it’s also a productivity bottleneck. Our solution transforms email chaos into clarity. Using machine learning and NLP, we automatically classify incoming emails and surface actionable insights through two intuitive interfaces: a conversational chatbot and a visual dashboard. Whether you're a frontline employee or an executive, you get the right message, at the right time, with the right context.

Designed for secure, proxy-restricted environments, our system integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Exchange and respects internal-only constraints. It’s modular, scalable, and built to evolve—whether that’s adding new categories, integrating with Teams, or adapting to user feedback.

The result? Less time sorting, more time acting. We’re not just improving email—we’re unlocking enterprise productivity.”

🧠 Judges’ Commentary
“This project hits the sweet spot between automation, usability, and enterprise readiness. The dual interface design shows empathy for different user personas, and the ML/NLP integration is both elegant and practical. With minor enhancements—like role-based access, audit logs, or adaptive learning—it could be production-ready for large-scale deployment.”

Business Case
Modern enterprises face an overwhelming volume of emails, many of which require categorization, triage, and action. Manual sorting is inefficient, error-prone, and costly. This project introduces an AI-powered email classification and interaction system that automates sorting, enables conversational querying, and streamlines decision-making—dramatically improving productivity and governance.

Target Outcomes:

Reduce manual email triage time by 70%

Improve classification accuracy and consistency

Enable actionable insights via dashboard and conversational interface

Enhance compliance and auditability through structured email handling

🚀 Key Features
1. Automated Email Classification
Connects securely to Microsoft Exchange Server

Extracts metadata: From, To, Subject, Body, Received Date

Uses Scikit-learn Random Forest model to assign predefined labels (e.g., Finance, HR, Legal)

2. Conversational Query Interface
Built with Python Flask and integrated with spaCy NLP

Users ask natural-language questions (e.g., “Show me pending approvals”)

spaCy predicts category → retrieves matching emails from memory

Displays results in chat history as a serial-numbered table

3. Actionable Chat Commands
Users can respond with commands like Send 1,4 as Approved

System sends selected emails with custom messages

Supports email composition directly from chat

4. Dashboard Visualization
React-based dashboard for non-chat users

Displays categorized email volumes, trends, and actions

Real-time updates from the Sklearn classifier

"""
Build a Flask-based HTML UI for an AI email assistant chatbot.

UI Layout:
- Use Bootstrap 5 for styling with a vibrant, modern theme (e.g., indigo, teal, or cyan accents).
- Split the page layout into two main columns:
  1. Left column (75% width):
     - Chat window showing:
       - User input and agent replies styled as chat bubbles
       - Input textbox at bottom with a "Send" button
     - Below chat, display an email results table (if any emails are shown by category)
       - Columns: Serial No, Subject, Sender, Date, Category, Status
       - Add badge colors based on category (e.g., HR=blue, IT=red, Finance=green)
       - Use alternating row colors and hover effects for better UX
  2. Right column (25% width sidebar):
     - Display a vertical summary panel:
       - Category count (e.g., HR: 5, IT: 2, etc.) using Bootstrap badges or progress bars
       - Display "Tips & Commands" section with examples:
         - “Try: show HR emails”
         - “Try: send 1,2 with approved”
         - “Try: where is my payslip?”
     - Use a card UI with rounded corners and drop shadow for modern look

Functional Requirements:
- Use Flask template (`chat.html`) with Jinja2 variables for:
  - Message history (chat)
  - Email list (table)
  - Category counts
- Auto-scroll chat to bottom on new message
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

Don't use any external AI API or LangChain.
