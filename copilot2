Build a Flask-based HTML UI for an AI email assistant chatbot.

UI Layout:
- Use Bootstrap 5 for styling with a vibrant, modern theme (e.g., indigo, teal, or cyan accents).
- Split the page layout into two main columns:
  1. Left column (75% width):
     - Chat window showing:
       - User input and agent replies styled as chat bubbles
       - Input textbox at bottom with a "Send" button
     - Below chat, display an email results table (if any emails are shown by category)
       - Columns: Serial No, Subject, Sender, Date, Category, Status
       - Add badge colors based on category (e.g., HR=blue, IT=red, Finance=green)
       - Use alternating row colors and hover effects for better UX
  2. Right column (25% width sidebar):
     - Display a vertical summary panel:
       - Category count (e.g., HR: 5, IT: 2, etc.) using Bootstrap badges or progress bars
       - Display "Tips & Commands" section with examples:
         - “Try: show HR emails”
         - “Try: send 1,2 with approved”
         - “Try: where is my payslip?”
     - Use a card UI with rounded corners and drop shadow for modern look

Functional Requirements:
- Use Flask template (`chat.html`) with Jinja2 variables for:
  - Message history (chat)
  - Email list (table)
  - Category counts
- Auto-scroll chat to bottom on new message
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

Don't use any external AI API or LangChain.
