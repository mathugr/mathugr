Business Case
Modern enterprises face an overwhelming volume of emails, many of which require categorization, triage, and action. Manual sorting is inefficient, error-prone, and costly. This project introduces an AI-powered email classification and interaction system that automates sorting, enables conversational querying, and streamlines decision-making‚Äîdramatically improving productivity and governance.

Target Outcomes:

Reduce manual email triage time by 70%

Improve classification accuracy and consistency

Enable actionable insights via dashboard and conversational interface

Enhance compliance and auditability through structured email handling

üöÄ Key Features
1. Automated Email Classification
Connects securely to Microsoft Exchange Server

Extracts metadata: From, To, Subject, Body, Received Date

Uses Scikit-learn Random Forest model to assign predefined labels (e.g., Finance, HR, Legal)

2. Conversational Query Interface
Built with Python Flask and integrated with spaCy NLP

Users ask natural-language questions (e.g., ‚ÄúShow me pending approvals‚Äù)

spaCy predicts category ‚Üí retrieves matching emails from memory

Displays results in chat history as a serial-numbered table

3. Actionable Chat Commands
Users can respond with commands like Send 1,4 as Approved

System sends selected emails with custom messages

Supports email composition directly from chat

4. Dashboard Visualization
React-based dashboard for non-chat users

Displays categorized email volumes, trends, and actions

Real-time updates from the Sklearn classifier

"""
Build a Flask-based HTML UI for an AI email assistant chatbot.

UI Layout:
- Use Bootstrap 5 for styling with a vibrant, modern theme (e.g., indigo, teal, or cyan accents).
- Split the page layout into two main columns:
  1. Left column (75% width):
     - Chat window showing:
       - User input and agent replies styled as chat bubbles
       - Input textbox at bottom with a "Send" button
     - Below chat, display an email results table (if any emails are shown by category)
       - Columns: Serial No, Subject, Sender, Date, Category, Status
       - Add badge colors based on category (e.g., HR=blue, IT=red, Finance=green)
       - Use alternating row colors and hover effects for better UX
  2. Right column (25% width sidebar):
     - Display a vertical summary panel:
       - Category count (e.g., HR: 5, IT: 2, etc.) using Bootstrap badges or progress bars
       - Display "Tips & Commands" section with examples:
         - ‚ÄúTry: show HR emails‚Äù
         - ‚ÄúTry: send 1,2 with approved‚Äù
         - ‚ÄúTry: where is my payslip?‚Äù
     - Use a card UI with rounded corners and drop shadow for modern look

Functional Requirements:
- Use Flask template (`chat.html`) with Jinja2 variables for:
  - Message history (chat)
  - Email list (table)
  - Category counts
- Auto-scroll chat to bottom on new message
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

Don't use any external AI API or LangChain.
