cope of Threat Modeling:
High-level scope: Assume that each application will undergo a standard threat modeling process, focusing on key areas such as authentication, authorization, data flow, and external dependencies.
Tooling: Assume the availability of threat modeling tools (e.g., Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, OWASP Threat Dragon) that can streamline the process.
Stakeholder Involvement: Assume the availability of subject matter experts (SMEs) and application owners for consultation.
Historical Data: Assume that historical security incidents and existing documentation (like architecture diagrams) are available for each application.
Environment: Assume that all applications are running in a consistent environment (e.g., same cloud platform or data center) which reduces complexity.
2. Define T-Shirt Sizing for Efforts
XS (Extra Small):

Criteria: Simple applications with minimal external dependencies, low user interaction, and straightforward data flows.
Effort: 1-2 days per application.
Example: Internal tools or scripts used by small teams.
S (Small):

Criteria: Applications with moderate complexity, limited user roles, and basic data handling, possibly with a few external APIs or third-party services.
Effort: 2-4 days per application.
Example: Internal dashboards, basic reporting tools.
M (Medium):

Criteria: Applications with several user roles, complex data flows, integration with multiple APIs or third-party services, and handling sensitive data.
Effort: 5-7 days per application.
Example: E-commerce sites, enterprise internal portals.
L (Large):

Criteria: Highly complex applications with extensive external integrations, numerous user roles, handling sensitive or regulated data, and requiring detailed threat modeling.
Effort: 8-12 days per application.
Example: Enterprise-level CRM, ERP systems.
XL (Extra Large):

Criteria: Very large, mission-critical applications with global user bases, extensive integrations, and stringent security requirements.
Effort: 12+ days per application.
Example: Online banking systems, global payment processing platforms.
