Q1;;Introduce about yourself.;;I am Mathu Raman, a Solution Architect at Bank of America with six years of experience. I began my career as a Data Architect designing the Authorized Data Source for Treasury, which consolidated banking payments and deposits. Later, I built CashPro by developing an operational database from scratch. In my current role, I oversee architectural governance by working with vendors and internal project teams to ensure software designs adhere to bank standards, robust security practices, and scalable, deployable systems with CI/CD capabilities.
Q2;;What is a solution architecture challenge you have faced, and how did you solve it?;;Challenge 1: Scaling HR Tech Jobs Efficiently;;Issue: The HR Technology team had workload peaks during evenings with underutilized resources during the day, leading to inefficient use of web servers and higher costs.;;Solution: Proposed migrating to a container-based solution (using OpenShift) that dynamically scales workloads through containerized pods, optimizing resource usage and reducing costs, along with a streamlined CI/CD pipeline.;;Challenge 2: Securely Exposing Internal APIs for Visitor Management;;Issue: The existing internal-only visitor management system created access issues for external vendors, contractors, and food delivery services.;;Solution: Designed a secure API strategy featuring mutual TLS (mTLS) for encryption;;OAuth-based authentication for identity verification;;Token-based authorization for access control;;Proxy whitelisting to restrict external access, ensuring both security and controlled exposure.
Q3;;Explain your role as a Data Solution Architect.;;In my role as a Data Solution Architect, I am responsible for:;;Blueprint Creation: Defining the current, target, and transition architectures for enterprise data solutions.;;Capability Matrix: Assessing existing data capabilities and identifying gaps for improvement.;;Architecture Reviews: Conducting monthly reviews with the architecture board to ensure best practices and compliance.;;Security & Compliance: Ensuring both internal and external applications adhere to robust authentication, authorization, and certificate management standards (e.g., proper SSL certificate usage and secure storage via AWS KMS or equivalent systems).;;Troubleshooting: Assisting teams with complex data pipeline issues, API performance bottlenecks, and overall architectural optimizations.
Q4;;Explain your experience as a Data Architect.;;I have extensive experience in data engineering, migration, pipeline development, and database architecture across both analytical and operational systems. Key highlights include:;;Data Governance & Security: Implementing access controls, role-based authentication, and authorization policies.;;Real-Time Payments (RTP): Led a year-long project developing a real-time and near real-time payment processing system that included high-throughput data ingestion pipelines and event-driven architectures using Kafka.;;Data Localization & Compliance: Developed data pipelines to support localization efforts by integrating with systems like Bank-in-a-Box, extracting and transforming data from various regions (e.g., Indonesia), ensuring compliance with regional banking regulations.;;Big Data & Streaming: Designed systems for both batch and real-time processing using technologies such as Kafka, Spark, and cloud-based data lakes.

cope of Threat Modeling:
High-level scope: Assume that each application will undergo a standard threat modeling process, focusing on key areas such as authentication, authorization, data flow, and external dependencies.
Tooling: Assume the availability of threat modeling tools (e.g., Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, OWASP Threat Dragon) that can streamline the process.
Stakeholder Involvement: Assume the availability of subject matter experts (SMEs) and application owners for consultation.
Historical Data: Assume that historical security incidents and existing documentation (like architecture diagrams) are available for each application.
Environment: Assume that all applications are running in a consistent environment (e.g., same cloud platform or data center) which reduces complexity.
2. Define T-Shirt Sizing for Efforts
XS (Extra Small):

Criteria: Simple applications with minimal external dependencies, low user interaction, and straightforward data flows.
Effort: 1-2 days per application.
Example: Internal tools or scripts used by small teams.
S (Small):

Criteria: Applications with moderate complexity, limited user roles, and basic data handling, possibly with a few external APIs or third-party services.
Effort: 2-4 days per application.
Example: Internal dashboards, basic reporting tools.
M (Medium):
