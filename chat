At its core, the solution is structured around four integrated panels, each designed to optimize productivity and reduce manual overhead:

✅ 1. Ask-a-Question Panel (Left Panel)

Natural language interface: users can ask things like
“Show appreciation emails,” or
“Send items 2 and 3 as approved.”

Automatically interprets user intent — whether it's a query, command, or action.

Eliminates the need for menus or filters — just ask, and it responds.

✅ 2. Chat History Panel (Center Panel)

Real-time log of all interactions, questions, system responses, and user actions.

Serves as a contextual timeline and an auditable activity trail.

Enables seamless follow-up without losing track of prior conversations.

✅ 3. Insights & Actions Panel (Right Panel)

Displays live category counts (e.g., HR, Business, Appreciation).

Offers Tips & Tricks for advanced actions like batch-sending, summarizing, or retrieving data.

Includes quick action buttons to immediately act on retrieved results.

✅ 4. Smart Template & Reply Panel (Bottom or Contextual Panel)

When a category like “Appreciation” is selected, matching emails are shown.

Users can choose from tone-specific templates: Friendly, Empathetic, Business, or General.

Templates are fully editable before sending, and every message is logged back in the chat history.
n under 60 seconds, users can go from overwhelmed inbox to categorized insights, auto-generated replies, and auditable action logs — all within one cohesive experience.

This isn’t just email automation. This is the foundation of an intelligent communication platform—designed for enterprise scale.

You are GitHub Copilot. Generate ONE self-contained HTML file (inline CSS + vanilla JS) for an “Email Categorization Dashboard”.

STRICT OUTPUT: Only provide the complete HTML document (<!doctype html> … </html>) with embedded <style> and <script>. No external libraries, no extra commentary.

GOAL
- A clean, accessible dashboard to browse categorized emails, show category counts, and display FAQs.

DATA INPUTS (provided by the hosting page/app; design graceful fallbacks):
- `list_emails` (optional): a function that returns an Array OR a Promise<Array> of email objects.
- `window.emails` (optional): Array of email objects if `list_emails` is not available.
- `window.category_counts` (optional): Dict with keys like "HR", "Important". If missing, compute counts from emails.
- `window.faqs` (optional): Array of { q: string, a: string }. If missing, show 3 sensible examples.

EMAIL SHAPE (assume keys exist; handle missing with safe defaults):
{
  id: number|string,
  from: string,
  to: string,
  subject: string,
  body: string,
  category: string,          // e.g., "HR", "IT", "Finance", "Important"
  received_date: string      // e.g., "2025-08-25 09:12"
}

PAGE REQUIREMENTS
1) Header
   - Title text: "Email Categorization Dashboard"

2) LEFT COLUMN
   - Three small “count cards” labeled exactly:
     • "HR Emails" → value from category_counts.HR (or computed)
     • "Important Emails" → value from category_counts.Important (or computed)
     • "FAQ Topics" → number of items in `faqs`
   - Expandable FAQ section:
     • Render from `faqs` array/dict using <details>/<summary>
     • Show at least 3 examples if none provided

3) RIGHT COLUMN
   - Search input (type=search) to filter emails by subject or sender (`from`)
     • Case-insensitive, updates on input (with a small debounce ~150ms)
     • “Clear” button to reset search
   - Email list table with columns: Sender | Subject | Category
     • Clicking a row shows email details in a preview pane below
   - Preview pane shows:
     • Meta line: “from → to • received_date”
     • Subject + a colored badge for category
     • Body in a scrollable <pre>
   - On initial load, if there are any emails, auto-select the first email to show its preview

DATA LOADING LOGIC
- If `typeof list_emails === "function"`:
    • Try `await list_emails()` (handle both sync and async).
  Else if `Array.isArray(window.emails)`:
    • Use `window.emails`.
  Else:
    • Provide a small inline fallback array (2–4 items) so the page still renders.

CATEGORY COUNTS
- If `window.category_counts` is present, use it to populate “HR Emails” and “Important Emails”.
- Otherwise, compute counts from the current emails array by matching category (case-insensitive).

FAQS
- If `window.faqs` is present, render it.
- Otherwise, render three example Q&A pairs (e.g., categorization rules, search behavior, preview usage).

STYLE & ACCESSIBILITY
- Simple, modern CSS (no frameworks). Use CSS variables for colors.
- Responsive 2-column layout; collapses to 1 column on narrow screens.
- Sticky table header. Hover highlight on rows.
- Clear visual badge colors for categories (e.g., green for HR, red for Important, neutral for others).
- Use semantic HTML: <header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, etc.
- Add basic ARIA where it helps (e.g., aria-live on the preview container).

JAVASCRIPT BEHAVIOR
- Functions to implement:
  • loadData(): resolve emails, counts, faqs using the rules above
  • renderCounts(category_counts, faqs)
  • renderFaqs(faqs)
  • renderTable(emails) and showPreview(email)
  • applyFilter(query): filters by subject or sender; preserves selection if still visible
- Keep the state in JS (current emails array, filtered view, selected email).
- No external network calls; only use the provided data/functions.
- Don’t throw on missing fields—guard with defaults.

VALIDATION
- After codegen, page should load and function using only the inline fallback data.
- Search must filter instantly and update the table + preview.
- Counts must reflect either provided `category_counts` or computed values.
- FAQs must render from data or fallback examples.

Only output the single complete HTML file as requested.
