Diagram Description
User's Browser:

Frontend Application: The user interacts with the frontend application.
Authentication: Handles user ID/password with MFA.
API Key Storage: Stores the API key used for client API authentication.
PingFederate Token Handling: Manages retrieval and storage of PingFederate tokens. Tokens are used for authenticated requests to the client API and AWS services.
Client Proxy Server:

Proxy Authentication: Handles authentication for the proxy.
Proxy Server: Routes requests through the proxy to the internal network.
Client's Internal Network:

Client API Server: Validates both the API key and the PingFederate token. Handles API requests.
PingFederate Authentication (No SSO): Manages token validation without SSO.
AWS Cloud Infrastructure:

AWS Services: Interacts with AWS services.
Secure Storage: Manages AWS credentials and secrets.
Data Flow
User Authentication and Token Handling:

The user authenticates using MFA.
The frontend application retrieves a PingFederate token for accessing the client API and AWS.
API Calls through Proxy:

The frontend application sends API requests through the proxy server.
Requests include both the API key and the PingFederate token for authentication.
Client API Access:

The client’s API server verifies the API key and PingFederate token.
The server processes the request and returns the data.
AWS Integration:

The frontend application accesses AWS services using the PingFederate token or AWS credentials.
Security Considerations
Token Handling: Securely store and manage PingFederate tokens and API keys.
Data Encryption: Use TLS for data in transit and ensure encryption for data at rest.
Proxy Security: Secure proxy authentication and routing.
Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring for API access, token usage, and security events.




*1. Understanding Client's PingFederate Setup
PingFederate Environment Details:
Endpoint URLs: Obtain the URLs for PingFederate endpoints, such as the OAuth2 Authorization Endpoint, Token Endpoint, and UserInfo Endpoint.
Token Types: Understand the types of tokens that PingFederate issues (e.g., access tokens, refresh tokens, ID tokens).
Grant Types Supported: Confirm which OAuth2 grant types are supported (e.g., Authorization Code, Client Credentials, Resource Owner Password Credentials).
Scopes: Identify the scopes that are required for accessing client APIs or AWS services.
**2. Client's Application Registration
Client ID and Secret:

Register the vendor application with the client’s PingFederate instance to obtain a Client ID and Client Secret. These credentials are used to authenticate the vendor application with PingFederate.
Redirect URIs:

Define the redirect URIs for the vendor application where the authorization code or tokens will be sent after authentication.
**3. Token Retrieval Process
OAuth2 Flow Integration:

Authorization Code Flow: For user-based authentication, integrate the Authorization Code flow where users authenticate, and an authorization code is exchanged for an access token.
Client Credentials Flow: For machine-to-machine authentication, use the Client Credentials flow to directly obtain an access token.
Token Exchange and Storage:

Implement secure methods to exchange authorization codes or credentials for tokens.
Secure Storage: Ensure tokens are stored securely, typically in encrypted storage or using secure cookies. Avoid storing tokens in local storage or other insecure places.
**4. Token Management
Token Expiry and Renewal:

Implement logic to handle token expiry. If the client’s PingFederate provides refresh tokens, use them to renew access tokens without requiring user re-authentication.
Set up automated token renewal processes to ensure seamless user experience.
Token Validation:

Implement mechanisms to validate tokens before using them in API calls to ensure they are still valid and have not been tampered with.
**5. Security Measures
Encryption and Secure Transmission:

Use TLS/SSL to encrypt all communications with the PingFederate server and client APIs.
Ensure tokens are encrypted at rest and during transmission.
Session Management:

Manage user sessions securely, ensuring that tokens are tied to specific user sessions and properly invalidated on logout.
Monitoring and Logging:

Log token retrieval, usage, and renewal activities securely for auditing purposes, but ensure sensitive information is not logged.
**6. API Integration Using Tokens
Authorization Headers:

For API requests to client-provided APIs or AWS services, include the access token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.
Token Scopes and API Access:

Ensure that the tokens have the appropriate scopes needed to access the specific client APIs and AWS services.
**7. Compliance and Client Policies
Adherence to Client Security Policies:
Ensure that all token handling practices comply with the client’s security policies and any applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
**8. Testing and Validation
Integration Testing:

Thoroughly test the token retrieval, storage, and usage processes in a staging environment to ensure they work as expected with the client’s PingFederate setup.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT):

Conduct UAT with the client to verify that the vendor application integrates correctly with the client’s PingFederate and meets all requirements.
By addressing these areas, the vendor architect can ensure that the vendor application securely and efficiently handles PingFederate tokens, enabling authenticated access to client APIs and AWS services.
