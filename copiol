Build a Flask-based chatbot web app that:

1. Accepts user input via a chat box.
2. Classifies the input as either a question or a command.
3. If it's a question (e.g. "show HR emails"), extract the category and filter a list of email dictionaries by that category.
4. If it's a command (e.g. "send 1,2 with approved"), parse the indexes and message using regex.
5. Show the filtered emails in a Bootstrap-styled HTML table with:
   - Serial number
   - Subject
   - Sender
   - Date
   - Category (badge color-coded)
   - Status (Pending or ✅ Sent)
6. When a send command is received, retrieve the email records by the selected indexes, and simulate sending an email (stub or print).
7. Mark the email records as sent and update the UI to reflect ✅ status.
8. Use Bootstrap 5 for styling, Google Fonts for modern look, and FontAwesome icons (optional).
9. Store email data in-memory using a list of dictionaries for now.
10. Ensure the app runs locally with minimal dependencies and easy to extend.

Include:
- `app.py` with Flask routes and logic
- `templates/chat.html` for UI
- `static/style.css` (optional) for custom colors
