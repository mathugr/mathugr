Unlike a stateless chatbot, an agent:

Keeps memory of past user actions

Chooses what to do next based on goals or context

Asks clarifying questions if unsure

Can run multi-step logic without needing explicit commands

This mimics what we call "Perception → Thought → Action" loop — the foundation of an autonomous agent in AI.

🧠 Bonus: AI Agent vs. LLM Agent
Feature	Local AI Agent (Yours)	LLM Agent (LangChain, AutoGen)
Memory	Class-based / dict	Memory chains / vector store
Intent detection	Regex + ML	LLM prompting
Decision-making	If-else + model	LLM chooses tool
Tool use	Email parser, classifier	LLM calls plugins / tools
Deployment	Flask app (offline)	Often cloud-based
Security	✅ Local, safe	❌ Risk of external API usage

✅ Summary
Your project is an AI Agent because it:

Tracks user state (not just messages)

Predicts categories with ML

Interacts with users autonomously

Executes decisions (send, reply) conditionally

Lives as a self-contained assistant — goal-driven and modular



"""
🔧 Build a secure, local AI-powered email assistant in Python (no LangChain or external APIs). The project includes training models, agent memory, and a Flask chatbot interface.

---

## 🧠 Part 1: AI Agent Logic (Pure Python)

Create a Python class-based AI agent that:

1. Tracks user intent and chat context with in-memory fields:
   - last_intent
   - selected_emails (list of indexes)
   - action_message (e.g., “approved”)
   - pending_action (send, reply, escalate)
   - awaiting_confirmation (bool)
   - interaction_history (optional list of past commands)

2. Supports two major interaction flows:
   - A. Viewing: If user says “Show HR emails” or “List finance issues”:
     - Parse intent and category
     - Retrieve and display matching emails from a hardcoded or in-memory list of email dicts
     - Render results as a color-coded HTML table (Bootstrap 5 theme)
   - B. Sending: If user says “Send 1,2 with approved”:
     - Extract email indexes and message via regex
     - Store this as a pending action and ask:
       “Do you want to send emails 1 and 2 with message ‘approved’?”

3. Handle “yes” or “no” confirmations to execute or cancel the action.

4. Respond clearly to unknown or ambiguous inputs:
   - “Sorry, I didn't understand. You can say 'show HR emails' or 'send 1,2 with message.'”

---

## 🧾 Part 2: Email Classifier Training (scikit-learn)

Train a scikit-learn text classification model to categorize emails by analyzing:
- `email.subject + email.body` combined

Steps:
1. Input data: List of dicts with keys: `subject`, `body`, `label` (e.g., HR, IT, Finance).
2. Use `TfidfVectorizer` for text feature extraction.
3. Use `LogisticRegression` or `LinearSVC` for classification.
4. Split dataset into training/testing, evaluate accuracy.
5. Save the model using `joblib.dump()` for reuse.

---

## ❓ Part 3: Question Classifier Training

Train another scikit-learn model to classify user **questions** like:
- “Where is my payslip?” → HR
- “Laptop not turning on” → IT

Steps:
1. Use a set of labeled Q&A training pairs: `question`, `category`
2. Use `TfidfVectorizer` + `LogisticRegression`
3. Save model with `joblib`

---

## 💬 Part 4: Flask Integration (Chatbot UI)

Integrate the AI agent and both models into a Flask-based chatbot:

1. User types a message in a chat input box.
2. Backend logic:
   - If input is a question: predict category with question model → fetch & display matching emails
   - If input is a command like “send 1,2 as approved”: extract info, confirm, then act
3. Render results as a Bootstrap HTML table with:
   - Serial number
   - Subject
   - Sender
   - Category badge
   - Sent/Pending status
4. Display follow-up questions like:
   - “Would you like to send those emails now?”
   - “Should I mark them as approved?”

---

🛡️ Notes:
- Entire project must run **locally**
- Do **not** use LangChain, OpenAI, or external APIs
- Everything must be in **pure Python + Flask + scikit-learn**
"""





"""
Build a Flask-based chatbot web app that:

1. Accepts user input via a chat box.
2. Distinguishes between:
   - Questions (e.g. "show HR emails", "what are the IT issues")
   - Commands (e.g. "send 1,2 with approved", "mark 3 as resolved")
3. Classifies each question into one of several categories (HR, IT, Finance, Security) using simple rule-based or ML classification.
4. If the user asks to show emails, display a Bootstrap-styled HTML table with:
   - Serial number
   - Subject
   - Sender
   - Date
   - Category badge
   - Status (✅ Sent or Pending)
5. If the user issues a send/action command (e.g., "send 1,2 with approved"), extract:
   - The indexes (e.g., 1 and 2)
   - The action message (e.g., "approved")
6. Filter email data by index and simulate sending (e.g., print or mark as sent).
7. After showing a filtered result, the chatbot must **ask a follow-up question**:
   - "Would you like to send this email?"
   - "Should I reply with this message?"
   - "Do you want me to mark this issue as resolved?"
   The user can reply with "yes", "send it", "cancel", etc.
8. Use a session variable to track the context between chatbot messages.
9. Keep all email data in-memory using a list of dictionaries.
10. Use Bootstrap 5 for the frontend UI and include a nice color theme.
11. Add simple command parsing with regex to extract action and indexes.

Files to generate:
- app.py (Flask logic and chatbot engine)
- templates/chat.html (chat UI with table and input)
- static/style.css (optional for theming)

"""

We are designing a chat-driven application that connects to Microsoft Outlook, ingests email metadata and content, and uses machine learning to categorize emails automatically. Users can query the system via chat to retrieve emails by category, view summarized results, and approve or take actions (such as flagging or delegating) directly from the chat interface.

(Assumptions:)

Target user base is within an enterprise using Microsoft 365/Outlook.

Email categories include predefined buckets like "Invoice", "HR Request", "Support", etc., and can be extended by the user.

Real-time classification and approvals are required.

Security and compliance with enterprise policies are mandatory.

Category,Judge's Question,Strong Possible Answer
Problem Statement,What problem does your solution solve?,"It reduces clutter in enterprise inboxes by automatically classifying emails and enabling chat-based approval or reply workflows."
Innovation,How is your approach different from standard tools like Outlook rules or filters?,"We provide real-time categorization, command-based approvals, and summarization via a conversational interface, not just filters."
AI/NLP Usage,How does the system classify emails and predict intent?,"We use a hybrid method: keyword-based classification for speed, and spaCy or TF-IDF models for contextual prediction."
Summarization,How do you summarize long email threads effectively?,"We use the T5 model locally, without external calls, to condense multi-step troubleshooting threads into structured summaries."
Security,How do you ensure email content isn’t leaked or stored insecurely?,"All email data is processed in-memory. No email content is stored. Models run offline using locally cached transformers."
Compliance,Is this compliant with corporate security policies (e.g., no email downloading)?,"Yes. The system avoids downloading or storing full emails. It uses metadata and secure in-memory pipelines only."
Extensibility,Can this be integrated with other systems (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow)?,"Yes. The architecture is modular, and the reply/action engine could trigger API calls to other platforms."
User Experience,How does the chatbot improve usability vs. traditional tools?,"Users interact naturally using commands (e.g., 'send 1,2 as approved'), and results are shown in a clean, color-coded UI."
Deployment,Where does this run, and how is it deployed securely?,"It runs on a secure internal Flask app with optional Dockerization. Models are preloaded; no internet access is required."
Scalability,Can this handle larger email volumes or multiple inboxes?,"Yes. It can be extended to read from multiple inboxes using Graph API and support pagination or indexing for performance."
ROI/Impact,What measurable benefit does this provide?,"It reduces triage time by up to 70%, improves email response SLAs, and reduces manual effort in categorization and reply handling."
Next Steps,What are your future plans for this solution?,"Add sentiment/tone detection, integration with AD groups for routing, and a dashboard for insights and reporting."




----
Must

onnect to Outlook mailboxes via Exchangelib (EWS) in Python with OAuth2.

Ingest and preprocess email metadata and content in real time.

Classify emails into predefined categories on-premise using a chosen ML framework.

Provide initial categories out of the box: Invoice, HR Request, Support, Approval, Appreciation, and Important (subcategories: Boss, Business Partners, Corporate Events).

Provide chat interface for querying by category and retrieving summarized results.

Enable approval actions (flag, delegate, archive) directly from chat.

Ensure data encryption at rest and in transit, and comply with enterprise security policies.

Should
Should

Allow users to define and extend custom categories via UI or chat commands.

Support multi-language email classification (e.g., English, Spanish).

Maintain an audit log of classification decisions and approvals.

Could

Offer automated retraining of the classification model based on user feedback.

Integrate with other Microsoft 365 services (Calendar, OneDrive).

Won’t

Use any external cloud ML services.

Store email content outside enterprise infrastructure.

(Next:) To refine these requirements, I have two questions:

What initial email categories do you want out of the box beyond Invoice, HR Request, and Support?

Do you have specific performance targets (e.g., max classification latency per email)?
